= Installation Instructions

== Dependencies
=== Dependencies for building the model
. Coq 8.11.0 (works with 8.17.1 now)
. GHC 8.6.5 or newer and Cabal (works with 9.4.4 now)

=== Dependencies for compiling the tests
. RISCV GCC 8.2.0-2019.02.0 (kinds of works with any riscv cross compiler; gcc 12.2.0)

=== Dependencies for running the Kami-generated Verilog model on riscv-tests
. Clang 3.8.0 or newer (works with 14.0.3)
. Verilator master branch (4.015 devel rev UNKNOWN_REV) (works with 5.014 2023-08-06 rev UNKNOWN.REV)

Note that the versions mentioned above are known to work. Try other versions at your own peril. In particular, GHC 8.2.2 or newer works; Clang 10.0.0 or newer works *but Clang 8.0.0 does not work*; Verilator 4.013 devel rev UNKNOWN_REV or newer works.


== Repositories needed to build the model
* RiscvSpecFormal: The top level repository containing the actual model in sub repositories along with several scripts for building and running https://github.com/sifive/RiscvSpecFormal
- FpuKami: The formal specification of IEEE floating point standard (IEEE 754) in Kami and an implementation in Kami https://github.com/sifive/FpuKami
- Kami: The Coq-based DSL + tactics + theorems to write and prove hardware in Coq https://github.com/sifive/Kami
- ProcKami: The formal specification of RISCV-ISA written in Kami https://github.com/sifive/ProcKami
- StdLibKami: The standard library of useful Kami modules https://github.com/sifive/StdLibKami
- bbv: The bitvector library from MIT (stands for Bedrock Bit Vectors) https://github.com/mit-plv/bbv
- coq-record-updates: Utility library for in-place updates of Coq (Gallina) records https://github.com/tchajed/coq-record-update

== Repository needed to run riscv-tests
* riscv-tests: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests


== Ubuntu-specific instructions
Note that in the following set of instructions `sudo` permission is needed to install the tools from Ubuntu's official repositories and other PPAs. One can also install these packages directly from sources without `sudo` permission. Please refer to the specific packages websites for instructions on how to do it. If the following instructions are followed one after the other, one should be able to build the model and run most of the tests in riscv-tests (the instructions for running the tests are also provided).

=== One time installation

==== Always necessary
===== Installing Coq
[source,shell]
----
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jgross-h/many-coq-versions --yes
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install coq-8.10.0 --yes
coqc --version
----

===== Installing GHC and Cabal
Note that this PPA installs `ghc` in a non-standard location (`$HOME/.ghcup/bin`) so as to not clobber your existing `ghc` installation.
[source,shell]
----
export BOOTSTRAP_HASKELL_NONINTERACTIVE=1
curl https://get-ghcup.haskell.org -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.ghcup/env
ghc --version
cabal --version
----

===== Installing RISCV GCC
These instructions install RISCV GCC on the current directory and adds that directory to the path for later commands to execute correctly.
[source,shell]
----
wget https://static.dev.sifive.com/dev-tools/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.2.0-2019.02.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14.tar.gz
tar xzf riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.2.0-2019.02.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14.tar.gz
export PATH=`pwd`/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.2.0-2019.02.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/bin:$PATH
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version
----

===== Installing RISCV tests
`riscv-tests` will be installed in `riscv-tests-install`.
[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests
cd riscv-tests
git submodule update --init --recursive
autoconf
./configure --prefix=`pwd`/../riscv-tests-install
make -j && make install
cd ..
----


==== Necessary for generating the Verilog model generated from Kami
===== Installing Clang
[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get install clang --yes
clang --version
----

===== Installing Verilator
Verilator will be install inside the directory `verilator-binary`, which will be added to the path.
[source,shell]
----
git clone http://git.veripool.org/git/verilator
cd verilator
autoconf
./configure --prefix=`pwd`/../verilator-binary
make -j 4 && make install
export PATH=`pwd`/../verilator-binary/bin:$PATH
verilator --version
cd ..
----

==== Necessary for generating the Haskell model generated from Kami
===== Installing Cabal packages
[source,shell]
----
cabal update
cabal install hashmap
cabal install vector
cabal install bv
cabal install random
cabal install primitive
----



=== Cloning the model.

[souce,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/sifive/RiscvSpecFormal.git
cd RiscvSpecFormal
git submodule update --init
----

=== Building and running the riscv-tests
The following command builds the model and runs the riscv-tests. `runTests.sh` requires the path of the directory where `riscv-tests` are installed.

==== Running the 32-bit tests on the Verilog model generated from Kami
[souce,shell]
----
./runTests.sh --path `pwd`/../riscv-tests/isa --xlen 32
----

==== Running the 64-bit tests on the Verilog model generated from Kami
[souce,shell]
----
./runTests.sh --path `pwd`/../riscv-tests/isa --xlen 64
----

==== Running the 32-bit tests on the Haskell model generated from Kami
[souce,shell]
----
./runTests.sh --path `pwd`/../riscv-tests/isa --haskell-sim --xlen 32
----

==== Running the 64-bit tests on the Haskell model generated from Kami
[souce,shell]
----
./runTests.sh --path `pwd`/../riscv-tests/isa --haskell-sim --xlen 64
----
